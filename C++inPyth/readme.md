# C++ in Python

I've been finding myself drawn back to Python again after a long hiatus on any python related programming. After the horrors of JS and it's weakly typed dynamic programming styles, dynamic languages have left a bad taste in my mouth, and I find it hard to reconcile this turn of events.

After much consideration, I began looking for other systems that could offer simmilar levels of flexibility while still supporting static types.

C would not be viable, as it's lack of OOP means that the act of integration would be more trouble than it's worth in relation to the value gained. While C is the lingua franqua of the programming landscape, it's limited language features make it incompatible with Python's fast development cycle.

C# would be nice, however due to the requirement of a windows environment or Mono make it less flexible than a language I would like to focus in.

Java was initially my first preference. However, I love Java's Libraries and syntax. It's comfortable and easy to use. However it's requirement of a JVM (I realize that this is debatably the main selling point of Java), makes it less flexible than I would like.

C++ was my final decision. Powerful but homely, expansive and complex. These are all values I treasure in a programming language. It's expansive nature make it a suitable complement to Python's simpler api.
