# Constrained Optimization Problem Generator
quick little tool I made during revision to generate constrained optimization problems - it generates random polynomial functions of x y z and then outputs the corresponding wolfram alpha text needed to solve online.

Didn't end up actually using it, but seemed like a nice little fun project.

## Screenshots
Don't you hate it when people don't include screenshots for project, thereby requiring you have to build it before you can evaluate whether it seems cool or not?
Me too.

Anyway, the output looks like:

(Not bad eh?)
